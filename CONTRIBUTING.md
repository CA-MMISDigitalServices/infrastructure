## External Contributions

The team does not currently have bandwidth to support community contributions, but hopefully this changes in the future after we've made a few releases. If there are questions, please feel free to post an Issue though!

Currently, the repo is designed to share released code for the sake of transparency and [eventually] re-use in other places.

## Internal Contributions

This repository should receive commits from the private version of this repository, making sure that anything released is safe and that it's understandable to external audiences. Commits should happen via pull request, be reviewed by one other member of the CA-MMIS Delta Team, and be tested.
